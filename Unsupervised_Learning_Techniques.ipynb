    "# Unsupervised Learning Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Although  most  of  the  applications  of  Machine  Learning  today  are  based  on  supervised learning (and as a result, this is where most of the investments go to), the vast majority  of  the  available  data  is  unlabeled:  we  have  the  input  features  X,  but  we  do not have the labels y. The computer scientist Yann LeCun famously said that “if intelligence  was  a  cake,  unsupervised  learning  would  be  the  cake,  supervised  learningwould  be  the  icing  on  the  cake,  and  reinforcement  learning  would  be  the  cherry  on the  cake.”  In  other  words,  there  is  a  huge  potential  in  unsupervised  learning  that  we have only barely started to sink our teeth into.\n",

    "In this chapter we will look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "    The goal is to group similar instances together into clusters. Clustering is a great tool  for  data  analysis,  customer  segmentation,  recommender  systems,  search engines,  image  segmentation,  semi-supervised  learning,  dimensionality  reduction, and more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "    The  objective  is  to  learn  what  “normal”  data  looks  like,  and  then  use  that  to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production line or a new trend in a time series.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Density estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is the task of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of the random process  that  generated  the  dataset.  Density  estimation  is  commonly  used  for anomaly detection: instances located in very low-density regions are likely to be anomalies. It is also useful for data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ready  for  some  cake?  We  will  start  with  clustering,  using  K-Means  and  DBSCAN, and then we will discuss Gaussian mixture models and see how they can be used for density estimation, clustering, and anomaly detection."
